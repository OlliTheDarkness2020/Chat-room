# Chat-room
Chat room is created using Node.js and Bootstrap using the [socket.io](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io) module
# Socket-io 
The backbreaking work	of the app really is done by the [socket.io](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io) Module.
This module helps us to communicate with the server and the client efficiently, especially without reloading the page.
socket.io also allows us to broadcast or 'send' response to other clients connected to the server except the one making the request.
